The dataset described in `documentation.tsv` is structured to store detailed information about immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor sequences, specifically focusing on their genetic rearrangements. This type of data is crucial in the study of adaptive immune responses. Each field in the dataset captures specific attributes of the sequence data, which are essential for immunogenetics analysis and research. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Sequence Information**: Includes the original nucleotide sequence ([sequence](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#2%2C65-2%2C65)), its amino acid translation ([sequence_aa](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#8%2C1-8%2C1)), and quality scores ([quality](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#6%2C1-6%2C1)). It also specifies if the sequence is reverse complemented ([rev_comp](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#10%2C1-10%2C1)).

2. **Gene Alignment and Annotation**: Details about the alignment of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes to reference sequences. This includes the gene calls ([v_call](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#20%2C1-20%2C1), [d_call](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#22%2C1-22%2C1), [j_call](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#26%2C1-26%2C1)), alignment scores, identities, and specific alignment positions in the sequence and reference gene ([v_sequence_start](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#109%2C1-109%2C1), [v_sequence_end](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#111%2C1-111%2C1), etc.).

3. **Productive and Frame Status**: Indicates whether the sequence is productive ([productive](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#12%2C1-12%2C1)), in-frame ([vj_in_frame](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#14%2C1-14%2C1)), contains stop codons ([stop_codon](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#15%2C1-15%2C1)), and spans the entire V(D)J region ([complete_vdj](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#16%2C1-16%2C1)).

4. **Region Specific Sequences**: Sequences and translations for specific regions like CDR (Complementarity Determining Regions) and FWR (Framework Regions), which are critical for determining the antigen-binding properties of the receptor.

5. **Germline Alignments**: Provides aligned germline sequences for comparison, which helps in understanding somatic hypermutations and other modifications relative to the original germline DNA.

6. **Additional Metrics**: Includes various metrics like junction lengths, palindromic nucleotide lengths, frameshift information, and counts related to sequencing technology (e.g., [umi_count](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#252%2C1-252%2C1) for Unique Molecular Identifiers).

7. **Metadata**: Identifiers for the cell of origin, clonal clusters, and links to broader study metadata ([cell_id](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#254%2C1-254%2C1), [clone_id](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#256%2C1-256%2C1), [repertoire_id](file:///Users/maxhager/projects_2024/bio_ml_hackathon/documenation.tsv#257%2C1-257%2C1)).

This dataset is typically used in immunological studies to analyze the diversity and clonality of B-cell and T-cell receptors, which are pivotal in the adaptive immune system. The detailed annotations and metrics allow researchers to perform in-depth analyses of immune repertoires, which can contribute to understanding immune responses, vaccine development, and disease pathology.
